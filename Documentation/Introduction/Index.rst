What does it do?
----------------

Simple FileCollection Gallery renders a FileCollection containing static images or folder based images.
It provides a simple layout with pagination and a lightbox.
Based on fluid templating the frontend layout can be edited fast and easy.

Since this gallery renders a set of files of a file collection it may render something else than an image gallery,
depending on the provided template. (e.g. List of downloadable files).
